							</P>This Confidentiality Agreement (the "Agreement"), dated as of ________________ ("Effective Date'"),
							is between <span id="ml-2013-02-100-1-span">**Disclosor**</span>, a <span id="ml-2013-02-20-4-span">**Disclosure State**</span>

Recipient shall safeguard the Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure using at least the degree of care it uses to protect its most sensitive information and no less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient shall promptly notify Disclosing Party of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information and use its best efforts to cooperate with Disclosing Party to prevent further use or disclosure. Recipient will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement caused by its Representatives.</P>

							<P>2.        "Confidential Information" means all non-public, proprietary or confidential information relating to Disclosing Party's <span id="ml-2013-02-20-9-span">**animal**</span>, in oral, visual, written, electronic, or other tangible or intangible form, whether or not marked or designated as 'confidential,' and all notes, analyses, summaries, and other materials prepared by Recipient or any of its Representatives that contain, are based on, or otherwise reflect, to any degree, any of the foregoing ("Notes"); provided, however, that Confidential Information does not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of Recipient's or its Representatives' act or omission; (b) is obtained by Recipient or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a third party that was not legally or contractually restricted from disclosing such information; (c) was in Recipient's or its Representatives' possession, as established by documentary evidence, before Disclosing Party's disclosure hereunder; or (d) was or is independently developed by Recipient or its Representatives, as established by documentary evidence, without using any Confidential Information.

							<P>3.                  If Recipient or any of its Representatives is required by applicable law or a valid legal order to disclose any Confidential Information, Recipient shall, before such disclosure, notify Disclosing Party of such requirements so that Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other remedy, and Recipient shall reasonably assist Disclosing Party therewith. If Recipient remains legally compelled to make such disclosure, it shall: (a) only disclose that portion of the Confidential Information that, in the written opinion of its outside legal counsel, Recipient is required to disclose; and (b) use reasonable efforts to ensure that such Confidential Information is afforded confidential treatment.</P>

							<P>4.

							<P>8.                  Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this Agreement will cause injury to Disclosing Party for which money damages would be an inadequate remedy and that, in addition to remedies at law, Disclosing Party is entitled to equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach.</P>
